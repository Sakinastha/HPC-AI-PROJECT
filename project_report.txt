 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. SPEEDUP ANALYSIS:
   • MPI: 1.73x faster than serial
   • GPU: 2.02x faster than serial

2. PARALLEL EFFICIENCY:
   Parallel efficiency measures how well we use additional processors.
   Ideal efficiency = 100% (perfect linear scaling)
   • MPI: 43.1% (with 4 processes)

3. WHY EFFICIENCY < 100%:
   • Communication overhead between MPI processes
   • Load imbalance (uneven work distribution)
   • Serial portions of code (Amdahl's Law)
   • Synchronization barriers

 HPC CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED
================================================================================

1. DISTRIBUTED MEMORY PARALLELISM (MPI)
   • Message Passing Interface - standard for HPC clusters
   • Data parallelism: Split dataset across processes
   • Gradient synchronization via all-reduce
   • Scalable to thousands of nodes

2. ACCELERATOR COMPUTING (GPU)
   • Heterogeneous computing: CPU + GPU
   • Massive parallelism: Thousands of GPU cores
   • Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
   • Unified memory architecture on M5

3. HYBRID PARALLELISM (MPI + GPU)
   • State-of-the-art HPC: Multi-node with GPUs
   • Used by modern supercomputers (Summit, Frontier)
   • Best of both: Distributed scale + GPU speed
   • Essential for training large AI models

4. PERFORMANCE METRICS
   • Speedup: How much faster than baseline
   • Efficiency: How well resources are utilized
   • Strong Scaling: Fixed problem, more resources
   • Communication Overhead: Cost of coordination
